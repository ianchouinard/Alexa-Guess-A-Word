# Guess A word Demo Alexa App
Source code for my Amazon Alexa game/skill "guess a word".
I didn't want to keep up with my limited dictionary api keys and/or maintain a large
local word dictionary, so I put up my code here for people to look at/hack at.

Origionally deployed to AWS.

## Usage
Initiate: "Alexa Guess A word"

Get A definition: "Give me a definition"

Guess the word to that definition: "The answer is {Word}"

Give up, get the answer: "I give up"
